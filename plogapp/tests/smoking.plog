% This program demostrated so called 'explaining-away' phenomenon using 
% an example from Chapter 6 of 'The Book of Why'. By Pearl & Mackenzie.
% Infant's death during birth can be explained by several factors, such as smoking 
% of his mother, his weight, and a certain defect during birth or his development.
% Defects are more likely to cause death, however both smoking and birth defects
% can contribute towards smaller weight. The interesting observation is as 
% follows. Given that we observed that the birth weight is low, additional 
% knowledge about the mother being a smoker can actually decrease the probability of death. 
% In other words, smoking can explain away other (more dangerous) factors contributing 
% to child's smaller weight.
