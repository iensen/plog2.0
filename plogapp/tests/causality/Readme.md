The programs in this directory, adapted to the syntax of the solver, is a product of joint research with Dr.Michael Gelfond on causal analysis in trajectories of dynamic domains. Each program represents T(S) for some scenario S and background theory T. Some axioms whose bodies are false in every model of all the presented scenarios are omitted to shorten the presentation. Note that  our solver uses cardinality-based preference for consistency restoring rules. 
Therefore, in one of the examples, courtorder.plog, for certain scenarios the possible worlds may be different from what is presented in the paper. We plan to address this limitation in future.

For detailed instructions on how to install the P-log solver and run the programs (compute possible worlds and probabilities), please refer to https://github.com/iensen/plog2.0/wiki.

For a quick example, given that P-log executable (named plog2.0) is available in the current folder, and plogapp/tests/causality/courorder.plog contains T(S) for scenario S = {dead(0) = false, obs(dead(3)}, this is how to compute the unique possible worlds of T(S):
```bash
./plog2 --mode=pw plogapp/tests/causality/courtorder.plog 
Plog 2.1
Possible Worlds:
1: {court_order(0), court_order(1) = false, court_order(2) = false, court_order(3) = false, captain_order(1), captain_order(0) = false, captain_order(2) = false, captain_order(3) = false, shoot(a, 2), shoot(b, 2), shoot(a, 0) = false, shoot(a, 1) = false, shoot(a, 3) = false, shoot(b, 0) = false, shoot(b, 1) = false, shoot(b, 3) = false, dead(3), dead(0) = false, dead(1) = false, dead(2) = false}

Probabilities:
1: 1
```
--mode=pw flag is used to indicate that possible worlds should be computed, rather than an answer to certain query.
